# **Project Plan: A Personal Portfolio Website and Low-Latency Trading System**

## **Executive Summary**

This document outlines a comprehensive project plan for the development and deployment of a dual-system platform. The primary objective is to construct a public-facing professional portfolio website that simultaneously serves as a control center for a private, high-performance, low-latency algorithmic trading system. This project is conceived as an advanced educational endeavor, designed to provide practical, industrial-grade experience in full-stack web development, ultra-low-latency systems engineering, and quantitative finance. The plan now defaults to professional-grade architectural principles and technologies from the outset.

The core deliverables of this project are fourfold:

1. A fully deployed, modern personal website accessible via a custom domain name.  
2. A modular, high-performance trading system, with its latency-critical components developed in C++, deployed on a dedicated bare-metal server to eliminate virtualization overhead.  
3. A high-fidelity backtesting framework capable of accurately simulating trading strategies against historical tick-by-tick data, accounting for critical factors like order queue position and network latency.  
4. An integrated, real-time web dashboard hosted on the personal website, providing comprehensive monitoring and control over the trading system's operations.

Key strategic decisions have been made to ensure the project's success within its technical and financial parameters. The frontend website will be built using the **Astro** framework, leveraging its "islands architecture" to host a dynamic dashboard built with **React** components. This approach ensures a high-performance static site while accommodating complex, real-time user interface requirements.1 The high-frequency trading (HFT) system will be architected as a set of decoupled microservices, using modern

**C++** for performance-critical components and **ZeroMQ** for lightweight, high-speed inter-process communication.3 To achieve the lowest possible latency, the system will employ

**kernel-bypass networking** using the **Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK)**, allowing the market data handler to ingest data directly from the network interface card (NIC), avoiding the overhead of the operating system's kernel.131 For other high-performance I/O tasks, such as logging, the system will utilize

**io\_uring** to minimize system call overhead.134 To facilitate realistic yet affordable operation, the system will interface with

**Alpaca** for brokerage services and **Polygon.io** for market data, chosen for their developer-friendly, low-cost APIs.5 Deployment will be on a

**bare-metal server**, prioritizing raw performance and predictable latency over the flexibility of cloud virtual machines.137

The project roadmap is structured into distinct, iterative phases. It begins with the foundational website, proceeds with the incremental development of the HFT system's components and backtester, and culminates in their integration, bare-metal deployment, and end-to-end testing. This phased approach prioritizes the early establishment of a functional system, which can be progressively refined and enhanced over time.

## **Part I: The Public Showcase \- Your Personal Website**

This initial part of the project focuses on establishing a robust and professional online presence. Given the user's lack of prior web development experience, the plan emphasizes modern tools and frameworks that simplify the development process while delivering a high-quality, performant, and visually appealing final product.

### **1.1 Framework Selection: Astro for Performance and Flexibility**

The choice of a web framework is a foundational decision that impacts performance, developer experience, and cost. For this project, a static-first approach is paramount.

Primary Recommendation: Astro  
Astro is a modern static site generator that is exceptionally well-suited for content-heavy websites such as portfolios, blogs, and marketing sites.2 Its core philosophy is "zero JavaScript by default," meaning it renders components to static HTML at build time, shipping the absolute minimum amount of client-side JavaScript necessary. This results in websites that load with remarkable speed, a critical factor for user retention and creating a professional first impression.2  
The most compelling feature of Astro for this project is its "Islands Architecture".2 This innovative approach allows developers to build a website that is predominantly static HTML, while specific, designated components—or "islands"—can be rendered as fully interactive client-side applications using popular UI frameworks like React or Vue. This hybrid model is perfectly aligned with the project's requirements: a largely static portfolio site that contains a highly dynamic, real-time trading dashboard. The portfolio pages remain lightweight and fast, while the dashboard island receives the necessary JavaScript to become a full-featured application.

Comparative Analysis: Astro vs. Next.js  
Next.js is a powerful and popular full-stack framework based on React, widely used for building dynamic web applications.7 While it is an excellent choice for complex, server-driven applications, its default reliance on client-side rendering and hydration can be suboptimal for a content-focused portfolio. This can lead to larger initial JavaScript bundles and potentially slower page loads compared to Astro's static-first approach.1 For the specific use case of a mostly static site hosting a single, complex real-time component, Astro offers a more optimized balance of performance and capability, avoiding the overhead of a full single-page application (SPA) where it is not needed.7  
The selection of a static-first framework like Astro is not merely a technical preference; it is a strategic decision that directly enables the project to meet its primary financial constraint. Modern hosting platforms such as Vercel and Netlify offer exceptionally generous free tiers for static websites, which include features like a global CDN, automatic HTTPS, and continuous deployment.13 A framework that generates a truly static site can fully leverage these free tiers. In contrast, frameworks that require a server runtime for features like server-side rendering (SSR) often push projects into paid hosting plans more quickly. Therefore, the choice of Astro allows the project to be deployed on Vercel's free tier, effectively reducing the website's static hosting cost to $0 and ensuring adherence to the project's strict budget.

### **1.2 Core Website Implementation: A Step-by-Step Guide**

This section provides a clear path for building the website from the ground up.

* **Environment Setup:** The first step is to prepare the local development environment. This involves installing Node.js (which includes the npm package manager) and a code editor like Visual Studio Code. Recommended VS Code extensions, such as the official Astro extension and Tailwind CSS IntelliSense, will significantly improve the development experience by providing syntax highlighting and autocompletion.18  
* **Project Initialization:** The project begins by running the npm create astro@latest command in the terminal. This command launches a setup wizard that guides the user through the initial project configuration.19 For this project, selecting the "Empty" template is recommended, as it provides a minimal starting point that is ideal for learning the framework's core concepts from scratch.  
* **Creating Pages and Routing:** Astro employs an intuitive file-based routing system. Any .astro file created within the src/pages/ directory automatically becomes a page on the website.9 The plan involves creating the essential pages for a professional portfolio:  
  * src/pages/index.astro: The homepage.  
  * src/pages/about.astro: A page for a personal biography and skills.  
  * src/pages/projects/index.astro: A landing page to showcase various projects.  
  * src/pages/projects/hft-dashboard.astro: The placeholder page that will eventually host the trading dashboard.  
* **Building with Components and Layouts:** To promote code reuse and maintainability, the plan introduces Astro's component and layout paradigms.9 A main  
  Layout.astro file will be created in src/layouts/ to contain the common HTML structure, including the \<head\> section, header, and footer, which will wrap all other pages. Reusable UI elements, such as a navigation bar, will be built as individual .astro components in src/components/.  
* **Styling with Tailwind CSS:** For styling, the plan recommends **Tailwind CSS**. Its utility-first approach allows for rapid development of modern, responsive designs directly within the HTML markup, which is particularly beneficial for those without extensive CSS experience.25 Tailwind can be easily added to the Astro project by running the command  
  npx astro add tailwind.

### **1.3 Deployment and Public Access: Going Live**

With the website structure in place, the next step is to make it publicly accessible.

* **Domain Name Registration:** A custom domain name is essential for a professional online presence.  
  * **Cost-Effective Options:** While many registrars exist, **Cloudflare Registrar** is recommended as it offers at-cost domain registration, meaning it does not add a markup to the wholesale price set by the registry.26 A standard  
    .com domain typically costs between $10 and $20 per year, which is well within the project's budget.27  
  * **Process:** The process involves searching for an available domain name on the registrar's website and completing the purchase.  
* **Hosting Platform Selection: Vercel**  
  * **Rationale:** Vercel is the premier platform for deploying modern web applications built with frameworks like Astro.29 Its key feature is a seamless integration with GitHub, which enables a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflow. Every time code is pushed to the GitHub repository, Vercel automatically triggers a new build and deployment, ensuring the live site is always up to date.30  
  * **Cost Analysis:** Vercel's "Hobby" plan is free and provides all the necessary features for this project, including 100 GB of monthly bandwidth, a global Content Delivery Network (CDN) for fast loading times worldwide, and automatic HTTPS for security. This makes the static hosting cost for the website effectively zero.13  
* **Step-by-Step Deployment Guide:**  
  1. **Version Control:** Initialize a Git repository in the project folder and push the code to a new repository on **GitHub**.  
  2. **Vercel Account:** Sign up for a **Vercel** account, using the option to authenticate with GitHub.  
  3. **Import Project:** From the Vercel dashboard, import the newly created GitHub repository. Vercel's build system will automatically detect that it is an Astro project and configure the necessary build commands and output directory settings.33  
  4. **Deploy:** Initiate the first deployment. Vercel will build the static site and assign it a unique .vercel.app URL for immediate access.  
  5. **Connect Custom Domain:** In the Vercel project settings, navigate to the "Domains" section. Add the custom domain purchased from Cloudflare. Vercel will provide two nameservers. The final step is to log in to the Cloudflare dashboard and update the domain's DNS settings to use the nameservers provided by Vercel. DNS propagation may take some time, after which the website will be live at the custom domain.34

## **Part II: The Engine Room \- The High-Frequency Trading System**

This part of the plan details the architecture and implementation of the low-latency trading system. The design is heavily influenced by the principles of professional quantitative trading systems, adapted for a cost-effective, single-machine deployment suitable for a personal project.41 The core tenets are modularity, performance, and adherence to industry best practices.

### **2.1 Core Principles and System Diagram**

The system's architecture is founded on principles that prioritize speed, scalability, and maintainability.

* **Event-Driven Architecture:** The system is designed around an event-driven model. Instead of components making direct, blocking calls to one another, they communicate asynchronously by publishing messages (events) to a central bus and subscribing to the events they are interested in. This paradigm is fundamental to building high-performance, concurrent systems as it decouples components and eliminates bottlenecks.42  
* **Decoupled Microservices:** Each core function of the trading system—such as market data ingestion, strategy execution, and order management—will be implemented as a separate, independent process. This microservices approach is critical for enhancing testability, allowing individual components to be developed and debugged in isolation. It also provides a clear path for future scalability and directly addresses the user's requirement for a modular system where components, like the market data source, can be easily swapped without affecting the entire system.41  
* **C++ for the "Hot Path":** All components that lie on the critical "hot path"—the sequence of operations from receiving a market data packet to sending a corresponding order to the exchange—will be implemented in modern C++ (specifically, C++20). This choice is driven by the need to achieve the lowest possible latency by minimizing runtime overhead, avoiding garbage collection pauses, and enabling fine-grained control over memory and CPU resources.3  
* **System Architecture Diagram:** The system comprises several key microservices communicating via an internal message bus.  
  * **Components:**  
    * **Market Data Handler:** Connects directly to the NIC using DPDK to ingest raw market data packets, bypassing the kernel.  
    * **Strategy Engine:** Subscribes to market data, applies trading logic, and generates trade signals.  
    * **Order Gateway:** Translates signals into brokerage-specific orders and manages their lifecycle using a user-space network stack.  
    * **Position & Risk Service:** Tracks the portfolio's state and enforces risk limits.  
    * **Low-Latency Logger:** Subscribes to system events and writes them to disk asynchronously using io\_uring.  
    * **WebSocket Bridge:** Relays internal system events to the frontend dashboard.  
    * **Control API:** Exposes a RESTful interface for manual control from the dashboard.  
  * **Data Flows:**  
    * **External Market Data:** Flows from the exchange network directly to the Market Data Handler via a dedicated NIC, processed by DPDK.  
    * **Orders & Executions:** Flow between the Order Gateway and the Brokerage API (e.g., Alpaca) over a user-space TCP/IP stack.  
    * **Internal Communication:** Events (market data, signals, executions) are passed between C++ services using ZeroMQ.  
    * **Dashboard Data:** A one-way stream of system state and performance data flows from the WebSocket Bridge to the React dashboard via a WebSocket connection.  
    * **Control Commands:** User-initiated commands flow from the dashboard via a REST API to the Control API service, which then dispatches them internally via ZeroMQ.

### **2.2 Component Deep-Dive**

Each component is designed with a single, well-defined responsibility, following the principles of a microservices architecture.

* **Market Data Handler (C++ with DPDK):**  
  * **Function:** This service is the system's ultra-low-latency gateway to the market. It will take exclusive control of a dedicated Network Interface Card (NIC) using the **Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK)**. Its sole responsibility is to bypass the kernel's network stack entirely, reading raw Ethernet frames directly from the NIC's hardware buffers into user-space memory.131 It then parses these packets, transforms the data into a standardized internal format, and publishes these normalized events onto the internal message bus.41  
  * **Design:** This component will use DPDK's poll-mode drivers (PMDs) to continuously poll the NIC for new packets, eliminating interrupt-driven overhead.139 To meet the requirement for swappable data sources for backtesting, the core parsing logic will be separated from the live data ingestion logic.  
  * **Performance:** As the first and most latency-sensitive component, its performance is paramount. The use of DPDK and kernel bypass is the key optimization, dramatically reducing the time from packet arrival on the wire to its availability in the application.132  
* **Strategy Engine (C++):**  
  * **Function:** This is the "brain" of the trading system. It subscribes to the normalized market data events published by the Market Data Handler. It maintains the necessary state for the chosen trading strategy, such as reconstructing the limit order book or calculating moving averages. When the strategy's logic identifies a trading opportunity, the engine generates a "Signal" event (e.g., "BUY 100 shares of AAPL at market") and publishes it to the message bus.41  
  * **Design:** The core trading logic will be encapsulated within a Strategy base class, allowing different strategies (e.g., Pairs Trading, Market Making) to be implemented and loaded into the engine via configuration.  
* **Order Gateway (C++ with User-Space Networking):**  
  * **Function:** This service acts as the bridge to the brokerage. It subscribes to "Signal" events from the Strategy Engine. Upon receiving a signal, it translates the internal command into the specific API format required by the broker and transmits the order. To maintain low latency on the outbound path, it will use a **user-space TCP/IP stack** built on top of DPDK, avoiding the kernel for network I/O.140 It is also responsible for managing the entire lifecycle of an order, listening for status updates from the broker and publishing these "Execution" events back onto the internal bus.41  
  * **Design:** A crucial feature will be a "dry-run" or "paper trading" mode. When this mode is enabled, the gateway will not send orders to the live brokerage. Instead, it will simulate order fills based on incoming market data, providing a safe and realistic environment for testing.  
* **Position & Risk Service (C++):**  
  * **Function:** This stateful service acts as the system's central ledger, maintaining the definitive record of the portfolio's financial state. It subscribes to "Execution" events from the Order Gateway to update current positions and calculate real-time Profit and Loss (P\&L). It also performs a critical pre-trade risk management function by subscribing to "Signal" events. Before an order is sent, this service can perform checks, such as verifying position limits or daily loss thresholds. If a risk check fails, it can publish a "VETO" event to prevent the Order Gateway from proceeding with the trade.53  
  * **Design:** As the single source of truth for portfolio state, this is the only component that requires persistent storage. It will periodically save its state to disk, enabling recovery in the event of a system restart or failure.  
* **Low-Latency Logger (C++ with io\_uring):**  
  * **Function:** A new dedicated service responsible for system-wide logging. It subscribes to a stream of log messages from all other services via the ZeroMQ bus. Its critical function is to write these logs to disk with minimal performance impact on the source applications.  
  * **Design:** To achieve this, the logger will use the modern Linux **io\_uring** asynchronous I/O interface.136 This allows the service to submit batches of write operations to the kernel with a single system call, avoiding the blocking and context-switching overhead of traditional synchronous file I/O.134 This ensures that logging activity does not introduce latency into the critical trading path.143

### **2.3 Inter-Process Communication (IPC): ZeroMQ**

The choice of communication mechanism between the C++ microservices is a critical architectural decision that directly impacts performance and design.

* **Technology Choice:** ZeroMQ is a high-performance asynchronous messaging library, not a full-fledged message broker. This distinction is key: it provides the raw power of socket-level messaging patterns without the overhead, latency, and single point of failure of a centralized broker daemon.4 For a system where all components run on a single machine, ZeroMQ's  
  inproc (in-process) and ipc (inter-process) transports offer extremely low-latency communication, effectively simulating a high-speed network within the server's memory.  
* **Pattern Implementation:** The system will leverage ZeroMQ's established messaging patterns to build a robust communication fabric:  
  * **Publish-Subscribe (PUB/SUB):** This pattern is ideal for one-to-many data distribution. The Market Data Handler will act as a PUB socket, broadcasting a continuous stream of market data. The Strategy Engine, Position & Risk Service, and WebSocket Bridge will all act as SUB sockets, subscribing to this stream.59 A known characteristic of ZeroMQ's PUB/SUB is the "slow joiner" problem, where a subscriber that connects after a publisher has started sending may miss initial messages.62 The system design must account for this, potentially by having new subscribers request a state snapshot from a stateful service upon connection.  
  * **Push-Pull (PUSH/PULL):** This pattern is used for distributing tasks among a set of workers. It ensures that each message is processed by only one recipient. This is perfect for the "Signal" events generated by the Strategy Engine. The engine will PUSH signals, and the Order Gateway and Position & Risk Service will PULL them, ensuring each trade signal is evaluated for risk and sent to the broker exactly once.58

Professional HFT systems often achieve decoupling through physically separate machines connected by specialized, low-latency network hardware—an approach that is financially prohibitive for a personal project.41 This project emulates the

*architectural benefits* of such a distributed system within the constraints of a single bare-metal machine. Inter-process communication (IPC) becomes the logical equivalent of a physical network. By selecting a high-performance IPC library like ZeroMQ, the system can be built as a collection of independent, single-responsibility executables. This allows each component to be developed, tested, and optimized in isolation, perfectly mirroring a professional microservices architecture while leveraging the near-zero latency of in-memory communication on a single server.64 This approach provides the best of both worlds: professional design patterns and budget-conscious implementation.

---

## **Part III: The Backtesting Simulator**

A high-fidelity backtesting framework is not an optional component but a core requirement for developing and validating any HFT strategy.144 It allows for the rigorous evaluation of an algorithm's performance on historical data, providing crucial insights before risking capital.145 The backtester must simulate the real-world trading environment as accurately as possible.

### **3.1 Backtester Architecture and Design**

The backtesting framework will be built as an integral part of the overall system, reusing many of the same components to ensure consistency between simulated and live performance. The core principle is to replace live data feeds and brokerage connections with historical data players and simulated execution handlers.41

* **Event-Driven Simulation:** The backtester will operate on the same event-driven principles as the live system. A central simulation engine will read historical, timestamped tick-by-tick data from storage and publish it onto the ZeroMQ message bus, perfectly mimicking the role of the live Market Data Handler.148  
* **Component Reusability:** The Strategy Engine and Position & Risk Service will be used without modification. They will subscribe to the historical data stream from the simulator just as they would to a live stream. This ensures the core logic being tested is identical to what will be deployed.  
* **Simulated Execution:** The OrderGateway will be run in a special "simulation" mode. Instead of sending orders to a broker, it will send them to a Fill Simulator module. This module will determine if and when an order would have been filled based on the historical data stream and a model of the order book queue.  
* **High-Fidelity Fill Simulation:** A simple backtester might assume an order fills instantly if its price crosses the market price. This is insufficient for HFT. A high-fidelity simulator must account for:  
  * **Order Queue Position:** When a limit order is placed, it joins a queue of other orders at the same price level. The simulator must estimate the order's position in this queue and only register a fill after a sufficient volume of trades has occurred at that price level.149 This requires reconstructing the limit order book from historical Level 2 data.  
  * **Latency Simulation:** The backtester will incorporate configurable latency models for both network transit (order to exchange) and processing time within each component.149 An order generated at time  
    *T* will only be considered by the Fill Simulator at time *T \+ latency*.  
* **Performance Analysis and Reporting:** After a simulation run is complete, a Performance Analyzer module will process the log of simulated trades to calculate key metrics, including:  
  * Total Profit and Loss (P\&L)  
  * Sharpe Ratio  
  * Maximum Drawdown  
  * Win/Loss Ratio  
  * Average Holding Period 144

### **3.2 Backtesting Workflow**

The process of using the backtester will follow a structured, repeatable workflow.

1. **Data Acquisition:** Download historical tick-by-tick trade and Level 2 order book data for the desired instruments and time period using the Polygon.io API. Store this data in an efficient file format (e.g., compressed CSV or a binary format) on the server.  
2. **Configuration:** Configure the backtest run. This includes specifying the historical data file(s), the strategy to be tested, initial capital, and latency parameters.  
3. **Execution:** Launch the backtesting application. The Historical Data Player reads the data file and publishes market events in chronological order to the ZeroMQ bus. The Strategy Engine consumes these events and generates trading signals. The Order Gateway (in simulation mode) receives these signals and passes them to the Fill Simulator, which determines fills based on the ongoing market data stream.  
4. **Analysis:** Once the data stream is exhausted, the Performance Analyzer generates a detailed report summarizing the strategy's performance. This report is the primary output used to evaluate and refine the trading algorithm.

This approach of building an integrated, high-fidelity backtester is essential. It moves beyond simple historical replays to create a realistic simulation environment, providing a much more accurate assessment of a strategy's potential real-world performance.41

## **Part IV: Implementation: Technology, Data, and Strategy**

This section delves into the specific technologies, data sources, and algorithmic logic that will bring the trading system to life. It emphasizes modern C++ practices, cost-effective data acquisition, and a well-defined starter trading strategy.

### **4.1 The C++ Advantage: Modern Techniques for Low Latency**

To achieve the performance required for an HFT system, the implementation will leverage modern C++ features and low-level optimization techniques.

* **Language Standard:** The project will be built using the **C++20** standard. This provides access to modern language features like concepts, ranges, and coroutines, which can lead to safer, more expressive, and more maintainable code without compromising the zero-overhead principle that is critical for performance.3  
* **Performance-Critical Techniques:**  
  * **Memory Management:** On the "hot path," dynamic memory allocation via new and delete will be strictly avoided. These operations can introduce non-deterministic latency due to heap contention and system calls. Instead, the system will favor stack allocation for temporary objects, pre-allocation of memory pools for frequently created objects, and using containers like std::vector that allocate contiguous memory blocks upfront.66  
  * **Cache Locality:** Modern CPUs are orders of magnitude faster than main memory; therefore, efficient use of the CPU cache is paramount. The system's data structures will be designed for cache-friendliness. This means preferring contiguous-memory containers like std::vector or std::array over node-based containers like std::list or std::map for data that is accessed sequentially or frequently. This principle, known as cache locality, ensures that when the CPU fetches one piece of data, adjacent data is also loaded into the cache, reducing the chance of a slow "cache miss" on subsequent accesses.66  
  * **Compiler Optimizations:** The code will be written to be "compiler-friendly," enabling maximum optimization. This includes using constexpr for compile-time computations, judicious use of inline for small, frequently called functions to eliminate function call overhead, and structuring code to minimize conditional branches, which can lead to costly pipeline flushes due to branch misprediction.70  
  * **Concurrency:** Within a single service, communication between threads must be highly efficient. The design will utilize lock-free data structures, such as a single-producer, single-consumer (SPSC) queue, for passing data between threads. This avoids the use of mutexes, which can cause thread suspension and context switching managed by the operating system kernel, introducing significant latency. The Disruptor pattern, a high-performance alternative to traditional queues, is a well-regarded design for this purpose.66

### **4.2 Sourcing Market Data on a Budget**

Access to real-time, tick-by-tick market data is one of the most significant cost barriers in institutional trading.41 This project requires a practical, low-cost solution that provides a realistic development and testing environment.

* **Recommended Solution: A Hybrid Approach**  
  * **Live/Paper Trading Data: Alpaca API.** Alpaca offers a free, real-time market data feed sourced from the Investors Exchange (IEX).73 While IEX only accounts for a fraction of the total U.S. market volume, its data is sufficient for developing, testing, and running a live paper trading system. Crucially, this data is delivered via a modern  
    **WebSocket** stream, which is the industry-standard protocol for receiving continuous, low-latency real-time updates.75  
  * **Historical/Backtesting Data: Polygon.io API.** For strategy development and backtesting, historical data is required. Polygon.io provides a free tier that includes access to historical end-of-day data and a limited number of API calls per minute for more granular historical data.6 This is ideal for downloading the datasets needed to perform the offline analysis for the pairs trading strategy.

| Market Data Provider | Data Type | Coverage | Cost (Free Tier) | API Type | Limitations |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Alpaca** | Real-time & Historical | IEX (Free), SIP (Paid) | Free tier includes unlimited IEX data | REST & WebSocket | Free tier data is from a single exchange (IEX) 74 |
| **Polygon.io** | Real-time & Historical | Full US Market (SIP) | Free tier: 5 API calls/min, delayed data | REST & WebSocket | Free tier is rate-limited and data is delayed 6 |
| **Finnhub** | Real-time & Historical | Global Stocks, Forex, Crypto | Free tier: 60 API calls/min | REST & WebSocket | Limited API calls on free tier 80 |
| **FMP** | Real-time & Historical | US Stocks, Forex, Crypto | Free tier: 250 API calls/day | REST | Very limited API calls on free tier 81 |

The combination of Alpaca for real-time streaming and Polygon.io for historical data provides a comprehensive and cost-effective solution that covers all the project's data needs without incurring significant monthly fees.

### **4.3 Brokerage Connectivity: Alpaca vs. Interactive Brokers (IBKR)**

The choice of brokerage API directly influences development complexity and the system's capabilities.

* **Primary Recommendation: Alpaca.** Alpaca is an API-first brokerage built specifically for developers and algorithmic traders.5 Its API is based on modern web standards (REST for requests, WebSocket for streaming updates), making it significantly easier to integrate into a custom application compared to legacy APIs.73 It offers commission-free trading on US stocks and a fully-featured paper trading environment that uses a separate set of API keys but mirrors the live trading API, which is invaluable for safe development and testing.85  
* **Alternative: Interactive Brokers (IBKR).** IBKR is a professional-grade broker offering access to a vast range of global markets and financial instruments.88 Its TWS API is powerful but also notoriously complex. It requires a "gateway" application (either the Trader Workstation or a headless gateway) to be running on the machine, and it uses a proprietary binary protocol, which presents a steeper learning curve.91 While a C++ API is available, community feedback suggests that integration can be challenging.91

For a personal project where the primary goal is to build a functional end-to-end system, minimizing development friction is more important than having access to every global market. The complexity of the IBKR API could easily derail the project, consuming valuable time that would be better spent on the core trading logic and system architecture. Alpaca's modern API represents the "path of least resistance" to achieving a working Order Gateway. Therefore, the project will begin with an Alpaca integration. The Order Gateway component will be designed around an abstract Brokerage interface, ensuring that an InteractiveBrokers adapter could be developed and added in the future as an enhancement, without requiring a rewrite of the entire system.

### **4.4 A Starter Strategy: Statistical Arbitrage (Pairs Trading)**

The system requires an initial trading strategy to implement and test. Pairs trading is an ideal choice as it is a well-documented, market-neutral strategy based on quantifiable statistical relationships.

* **Strategy Rationale:** Pairs trading is a form of statistical arbitrage that profits from the temporary divergence in price between two historically correlated assets, betting on their eventual convergence or "mean reversion".95 Its logic is purely quantitative, making it well-suited for algorithmic implementation.  
* **Implementation Steps:**  
  1. **Pair Selection (Offline Analysis):** This step is performed offline using historical data.  
     * Data acquisition: Use the Polygon.io API to download several years of historical daily price data for a universe of potentially related stocks (e.g., components of the S\&P 500, or stocks within the same sector like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo).  
     * Candidate identification: Identify potential pairs by finding stocks with a high correlation coefficient or a small sum of squared deviations between their normalized price series.98  
     * Statistical validation: The most critical step is to test for **cointegration** using the **Engle-Granger two-step test**.100 This test statistically validates that a long-term equilibrium relationship exists between the two price series. It involves two stages:  
       1. Run a linear regression on the log-prices of the two stocks (e.g., log(price\_A)=β⋅log(price\_B)+α).  
       2. Perform an Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test on the residuals (the error term) of this regression. If the residuals are stationary (i.e., the ADF test rejects the null hypothesis of a unit root), the pair is considered cointegrated.103  
  2. **Signal Generation (Real-time in Strategy Engine):**  
     * For a selected cointegrated pair, the Strategy Engine continuously calculates the spread in real-time using the formula: Spreadt​=log(price\_At​)−β⋅log(price\_Bt​), where β is the hedge ratio determined from the initial regression.  
     * The engine then normalizes this spread by calculating its rolling **Z-score**: Z−score=(current\_spread−rolling\_mean\_of\_spread)/rolling\_std\_dev\_of\_spread.99 The Z-score measures how many standard deviations the current spread is from its recent average.  
     * **Entry/Exit Logic:** Trading signals are generated based on thresholds for the Z-score.  
       * **Entry Long Spread:** If Z−score\<−2.0, the spread is considered unusually low (A is undervalued relative to B). The signal is to "buy the spread": buy stock A and short-sell β shares of stock B.  
       * **Entry Short Spread:** If Z−score\>+2.0, the spread is unusually high (A is overvalued relative to B). The signal is to "short the spread": short-sell stock A and buy β shares of stock B.  
       * **Exit:** If a position is open and the Z-score reverts towards its mean (e.g., ∣Z−score∣\<0.5), the signal is to close both legs of the trade to realize the profit.106  
* **Risk Management:**  
  * **Position Sizing:** The capital allocated to each trade will be determined by a simple rule, such as a fixed percentage of the total portfolio value (e.g., risk no more than 2% of capital on any single pairs trade).55  
  * **Stop-Loss:** A critical risk control is to implement a stop-loss based on the spread itself. If the Z-score continues to diverge and reaches an extreme level (e.g., ±3.0 standard deviations), the position is automatically closed. This protects against catastrophic losses in the event that the historical relationship between the pair breaks down permanently.113

## **Part V: The Command Center \- Visualization and Control**

This part details the creation of the user-facing dashboard, which serves as the primary interface for monitoring and interacting with the trading system. The guiding architectural principle is the strict separation of the user interface from the core trading engine to guarantee performance and stability.

### **5.1 Frontend Technology: React as an Astro Island**

The dashboard requires a technology stack capable of handling real-time data streams and providing a rich, interactive user experience.

* **Framework Choice:** **React** is the industry standard for building complex, component-based user interfaces and is an excellent choice for a data-intensive dashboard.10 To optimize performance for the overall website, the React dashboard will be implemented as an  
  **Astro island**. This means the React application will only be loaded on the specific dashboard page, using the client:load directive in Astro. This prevents the React library from being included on the static portfolio pages, keeping them lightweight and fast.  
* **Data Visualization:** A specialized charting library is essential for visualizing financial data effectively. **Lightweight Charts by TradingView** is a high-performance, open-source library specifically designed for financial charting, making it an ideal choice. Alternatives like Recharts or Nivo are powerful but are more general-purpose and may require more customization for financial use cases.117  
* **Component Libraries:** To accelerate the development of the UI, a pre-built component library such as **Shadcn/UI** or **Material-UI (MUI)** will be used. These libraries provide a comprehensive set of ready-to-use components like buttons, tables, modals, and layout grids, allowing the focus to remain on the dashboard's functionality rather than building basic UI elements from scratch.118

### **5.2 Backend-to-Frontend Communication: The WebSocket Bridge**

A robust and efficient communication channel is needed to stream data from the C++ backend to the browser-based dashboard.

* **The Challenge:** The C++ microservices communicate internally using ZeroMQ, a protocol that is not natively supported by web browsers. Therefore, a bridge is required to translate the internal message bus traffic into a web-friendly format.  
* **Architecture:** A dedicated **WebSocket Bridge** service will be implemented. This service will be a lightweight application (which can be written in Python or Node.js for simplicity, or C++ using a library like uWebSockets for maximum performance). Its functions are:  
  1. Act as a ZeroMQ subscriber, connecting to the internal message bus and listening for all relevant events (e.g., P\&L updates from the Position Service, execution reports from the Order Gateway, status updates from all services).  
  2. Host a WebSocket server. When a frontend client (the React dashboard) connects, the bridge will broadcast the received ZeroMQ messages to it over the WebSocket connection.  
* **Data Flow:** This architecture creates a one-way, real-time data stream from the core trading system to the dashboard. This design is critical for system integrity: the UI becomes a passive observer that cannot block or interfere with the performance of the latency-sensitive trading engine.76

The user's requirement for a dashboard that is "completely separate from the trading engine to ensure it cannot interfere with trading performance" is a professional-grade concern that dictates a specific architectural solution.41 A direct connection from the frontend to the core C++ components would create tight coupling and introduce potential performance risks; a slow network connection or a bug in the UI could block a critical trading thread. The WebSocket Bridge pattern enforces this separation by acting as an intermediary. It decouples the frontend's communication protocol (WebSockets) from the backend's (ZeroMQ). The trading engine remains entirely unaware of any UI clients; it simply publishes status messages to its internal bus. This architectural choice is a direct and robust solution to a primary user requirement, guaranteeing the integrity and performance of the trading core.

### **5.3 The Control Panel: Sending Commands to the Backend**

While data flow to the dashboard is one-way, the user also needs the ability to send commands to the system.

* **Architecture:** For control actions—such as "START TRADING," "STOP TRADING," or "LIQUIDATE ALL POSITIONS"—a simple **REST API** will be exposed by a new **Control API** service. This service will be a lightweight C++ application built using a modern C++ web framework like **Drogon** or **Boost.Beast**.123  
* **Data Flow:** The React dashboard will send secure HTTP requests (e.g., a POST request to /api/start) to the Control API. The Control API service will validate the request and then publish a corresponding command message onto the ZeroMQ bus. The relevant backend services (like the Strategy Engine or Order Gateway) will subscribe to these command messages and execute the requested action.  
* **Security:** This API endpoint is a critical control surface and must be secured. At a minimum, it will require an API key in the request headers. It should be configured on the server's firewall to only accept connections from the web server itself (localhost), preventing direct public access.

### **5.4 UI/UX for Trading Dashboards**

The design of the dashboard must prioritize clarity, information hierarchy, and actionable insights, allowing the user to understand the system's state at a glance.126

* **Key Principles:** The design will follow established UI/UX best practices. The most critical information will be placed at the top-left of the screen, following the natural "F-pattern" of how users scan web pages.128 Visual cues like color (green for positive P\&L/running status, red for negative P\&L/errors) will be used to convey information quickly.129  
* **Dashboard Views:** The dashboard will be organized into logical sections or tabs:  
  * **System Health View:** This view provides an operational overview. It will display the status of each microservice (e.g., a green light for "Connected," red for "Error"), the server's CPU and memory utilization, and a real-time log feed from the backend services.  
  * **Trading View:** This is the primary financial dashboard. It will feature a real-time chart of the strategy's equity curve, key performance indicators (KPIs) such as daily and total P\&L, a table of current open positions, and a log of recent trade executions.  
  * **Control Panel View:** This view provides the user with manual control over the system. It will include clear, well-labeled buttons to start and stop the trading strategy, adjust key risk parameters (like maximum position size), and a prominent "emergency stop" button that immediately liquidates all open positions and halts trading.53

  4. Test the ability to place paper trading orders and receive execution updates from Alpaca.  
  5. Develop a Python script to download historical tick data from Polygon.io and save it to CSV files.  
  6. Implement the Historical Data Player component for the backtester to read and publish historical data.  
  7. Implement the Fill Simulator module, including logic for order queue position estimation.  
  * **Goal:** The HFT system can process live data and interact with a paper trading account. The core components of the backtesting framework are functional.  
* **Phase 4: Strategy Implementation & Backtesting (2-3 weeks)**  
  1. Implement the full Pairs Trading strategy logic within the Strategy Engine.  
  2. Develop the offline Python analysis scripts to perform the Engle-Granger test and identify cointegrated stock pairs.  
  3. Run the complete backtester on a selected pair to validate the strategy's historical performance, generating a full performance report.  
  4. Iterate on strategy parameters based on backtesting results to optimize performance.  
  * **Goal:** A fully backtestable trading strategy with quantifiable and optimized performance metrics.  
* **Phase 5: Frontend Dashboard & Integration (3-4 weeks)**  
  1. Create the React components for the dashboard within the Astro project, placing them in an Astro island.  
  2. Implement the WebSocket Bridge and Control API services.  
  3. Connect the React dashboard to the WebSocket Bridge to display real-time data streams.  
  4. Implement control buttons in the dashboard UI that send HTTP requests to the Control API.  
  5. Design and build the three primary dashboard views: System Health, Trading, and Control Panel.  
  * **Goal:** A fully interactive, real-time dashboard is integrated with the backend system, providing both monitoring and control capabilities.  
* **Phase 6: Bare-Metal Deployment & End-to-End Testing (2-3 weeks)**  
  1. Provision a bare-metal server in a data center strategically located for low latency to exchange servers (e.g., Chicago for CME).  
  2. Configure the server's Linux OS for low-latency performance (e.g., kernel tuning, CPU isolation, disabling unnecessary services).  
  3. Install the C++ toolchain and all necessary dependencies (DPDK, etc.).  
  4. Create deployment scripts (e.g., using Docker and GitHub Actions) to automate building and running the C++ services on the server.  
  5. Configure server networking and firewall rules to securely expose the WebSocket and Control API endpoints.  
  6. Update the frontend application with the public IP address of the deployed backend services.  
  7. Conduct a comprehensive end-to-end test of the entire live system.  
  * **Goal:** The complete, integrated project is live, operational on bare-metal hardware, and accessible via the public internet.

### **6.2 Infrastructure, Deployment, and Cost Optimization**

To meet the user's request for the highest possible performance, the infrastructure will be based on a bare-metal server, which eliminates the "noisy neighbor" problem and performance unpredictability associated with virtualized cloud environments.137

* **Bare-Metal Provider Selection for HFT Backend:**  
  * **Requirements:** A dedicated server with a modern, high-frequency CPU (e.g., AMD Ryzen), NVMe SSDs, and a high-speed network interface. For trading US futures, a server located in a Chicago data center is ideal for minimizing latency to the CME exchange.154  
  * **Comparison:**

| Provider | Location Focus | CPU Examples | Est. Monthly Cost | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Cherry Servers** | Chicago, EU | AMD Ryzen 7700X/9900X | $158+ | High-performance AMD CPUs, flexible billing 154 |
| **OVHcloud** | Global | Various Intel/AMD | $65+ | Wide range of options, good value 158 |
| **QuantVPS** | Chicago | AMD Ryzen | $299+ (Dedicated) | Specialized for traders, co-located with CME 156 |
| **HostVenom** | Chicago | Intel/AMD | Custom Pricing | Premium network with direct exchange connections 159 |

\*   \*\*Recommendation:\*\* For a balance of cost and performance for this project, \*\*Cherry Servers\*\* or \*\*OVHcloud\*\* are excellent starting points. They offer modern hardware in key financial locations at a more accessible price point than highly specialized trading hosts.

* **Deployment Automation:**  
  * **Containerization:** To ensure a consistent and reproducible deployment environment, all backend C++ applications and the bridge/API services will be containerized using **Docker**. This encapsulates all dependencies within a portable image, simplifying the deployment process.130  
  * **CI/CD for Backend:** A basic CI/CD pipeline will be established using **GitHub Actions**. On every push to the main branch, a GitHub Actions workflow will automatically build the Docker images for each service and push them to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry). A simple deployment script on the server can then be run to pull the latest images and restart the services.  
* **Final Budget Analysis:**  
  * **Static Costs (Monthly):**  
    * Domain Name Registration: \~$1.25/month (based on $15/year).27  
    * Website Hosting (Vercel): $0 (Hobby Tier).13  
    * HFT Server (OVHcloud Bare Metal): \~$65/month (starting price).158  
    * **Total Estimated Static Cost: \~$66.25/month.**  
  * **Budgetary Note:** The shift to a bare-metal server to accommodate the request for kernel-bypass and other industrial-grade optimizations places the static cost slightly above the original $50/month target. This reflects the trade-off between the cost of consumer-grade cloud VMs and the higher performance and predictability of dedicated hardware, which is a prerequisite for ultra-low-latency trading.137  
  * **Active Running Costs (Hourly):**  
    * Data API Calls: The free tiers of Alpaca and Polygon.io should be sufficient for this project's needs, resulting in no direct cost.  
    * Cloud Server Costs: This is a fixed monthly cost, not hourly.  
    * Brokerage Commissions: $0 when using Alpaca for live trading.  
    * **Total Estimated Active Cost: \~$0/hour.** The primary operational cost is the fixed server fee, which is well below the user's \<$5/hour active running rate target.

### **6.3 Conclusion and Future Trajectory**

This project plan outlines a clear and achievable path to building a sophisticated, dual-purpose platform that combines a modern web presence with a high-performance algorithmic trading system. By adhering to this plan, the developer will gain invaluable hands-on experience in a wide range of in-demand technologies and concepts, including full-stack web development with Astro and React, low-latency C++ programming, microservices architecture with ZeroMQ, quantitative strategy development, and bare-metal server deployment and optimization.

Upon successful completion, the project will serve as a powerful portfolio piece and a robust foundation for further exploration. Potential future enhancements include:

* **Strategy Expansion:** Implementing more complex trading strategies, such as market making or other forms of statistical arbitrage, within the modular Strategy Engine.  
* **Hardware Acceleration:** Offloading the most latency-critical parts of the trading logic (such as parsing market data or pre-trade risk checks) from the CPU to an FPGA for nanosecond-level execution.41  
* **Live Trading:** After extensive and successful paper trading, transitioning the Order Gateway to a live-funded Alpaca account to trade with real capital.  
* **Brokerage Expansion:** Developing an InteractiveBrokers adapter for the Order Gateway to gain access to a wider array of markets, including options and futures.  
* **Advanced Dashboard Features:** Enhancing the UI with more detailed analytics, historical performance charting, and the ability to tune strategy parameters directly from the control panel.
